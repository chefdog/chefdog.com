  <excerpt>Voor wie met verve in het leven staat! Onze kenmerkende biologische melange is veelzijdig en vol, met tonen van fluweelzachte chocola, honing en bessen. Deze koffie brengt schwung in je leven, hoe je ‘m ook zet.</excerpt>
  <content>&lt;p&gt;This coffee comes from the COMSA cooperative (short for Caf&amp;eacute; Organico Marcala S.A.) in the Marcala region in Honduras &amp;ndash; a famous coffee region that has already been awarded several prizes for the great quality of its coffees. The area of Marcala is located on the slopes of the Montecillos mountains at an altitude of 1200 &amp;ndash; 1600 metres above sea level. COMSA is made up of 69 members who work together to grow and process 100% organic coffee using new, innovative methods. The COMSA farmers put great emphasis on preserving the flora and fauna of the region. They promote diversification of crops and biodiversity; citrus fruits and bananas are grown in direct proximity to the coffee. The coffee is produced under strict norms of organic production and is almost entirely shade-grown. This allows the cherries to develop over an extended period of time which intensifies the flavours in the cup. The farmers also process their coffee using the washed method which creates a very clean and sweet taste. One that everyone loves to drink!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

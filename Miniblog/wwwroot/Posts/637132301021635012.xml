  <excerpt>Onze donkerste branding. Kruidige vleug, zoete karamel, en dan: bam. Smaakexplosie. Zelfs liefhebbers van lichte branding weten deze parel op waarde te schatten.</excerpt>
  <content>&lt;p&gt;With the dream of a better life, Antonia Andrade Pereira Filho and Maria da Concel &amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o Costa Pereira decided to invest in his farm of 90 acres in the city of Carmo de Minas, Minas Gerais (Brazil). In 1971, they planted the first coffee seedlings in a city where coffee production was on the rise. For this coffees, the pulped natural process is used, which results in a more aromatic cup quality that is rich in flavour, homogenous and clean. Fazenda Irmas Pereira is internationally known and recognized for their high quality coffees, which have already won many awards for specialty coffees, like the Cup of Excellence BSCA (Brazil Specialty Coffee Association).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee from the Carmo de Minas micro-region is known for its full body and medium-to-high-acidity. The region, with its fertile lands and rugged terrain has gorgeous coffee plantations cultivated at high altitudes that vary between 900 and 1,500 metres. Temperatures are mild and rainfall is distributed uniformly over the year. This perfect natural environment and the careful coffee production practices carried out with efficiency and devotion by the Fazenda Sertao team are the perfect combination to cultivate exceptional coffees.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

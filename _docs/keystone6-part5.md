## 1. Install nextjs app
run `npx create-next-app@latest --typescript`

## 2. Configuration

Open package.json and edit the `dev` command into: 

```json
"scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev -p 3500"
},
```

## 3. Template

I have used a very simple free template, called Landing. There is very little styling need, most of them are located in the 
`styles\global.css`
